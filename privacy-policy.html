        <p class="ppSubHead">How Do We Use Your Email Address?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can
            cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other
            unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have
            authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited
            commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree
            to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we
            display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email
            addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you
            information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us
            through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time
            you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at
            the bottom of each email.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Could my information be transferred to other countries?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We are incorporated in India. Information collected via our website, through direct
            interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices
            or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in
            the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and
            transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you
            voluntarily consent to the trans- border transfer and hosting of such information.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Is the information collected through our service secure?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic,
            and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
            correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are fool proof, including
            encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow
            policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot
            guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your
            personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our
            compliance with that duty.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Can I update or correct my information?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on
            your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal
            company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and
            disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or
            correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications
            and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained
            about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates,
            corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information
            that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update,
            correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as
            requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making
            corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information
            at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of
            the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect
            information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form
            that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal
            information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated,
            corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically
            practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about
            you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Sale of Business</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger
            or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as
            defined herein), or that portion of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or
            in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in
            bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the
            terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Affiliates</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate

            directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership
            or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by
            those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfil the
            purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and
            who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need
            for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our
            systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>

        <p class="ppSubHead">Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area
            (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
            collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
        </p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">What is GDPR?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is
            protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">What is personal data?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad
            spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information,
            to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include
            financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address,
            sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">
        <ul>
            <li class="ppLi">Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should
                only be used
                in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
            <li class="ppLi">Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be
                used for that
                purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
            <li class="ppLi">Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
            <li class="ppLi">People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also
                request a
                copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another
                organization.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Why is GDPR important?</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal
            data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and
            imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we
            strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy
            practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
        <p class="ppSubHead">Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</p>
        <p class="ppDisc">We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR.
            We process or store all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation
            and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in
            accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60
            days.<br><br>We
            are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to
            access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self-service from the
            start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer support team is
